```

## Step 3: Configure Repository Settings

### Repository Topics (for discoverability)
Add these topics to your repository:
```

```

### Enable GitHub Pages (Optional)
If you want to host documentation:
1. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
2. Source: Deploy from a branch
3. Branch: main, folder: /docs
4. This will make your documentation available at `yourusername.github.io/unbuilt`

## Step 4: Create Demo GIF/Animation

### Quick Option - Use Screen Recording
1. **Install recording tool**:
   - Mac: [Kap](https://getkap.co/) (free)
   - Windows: [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) (free)
   - Online: [RecordScreen.io](https://recordscreen.io/)

2. **Record demo** (follow instructions in `docs/CREATE_DEMO.md`):
   - Go to: https://89a6ca3c-71b2-4a86-94dd-a44feac472df.janeway.prod.repl.run/
   - Record 30-45 second demonstration
   - Show: Landing page â†’ Search â†’ Results â†’ Action plan â†’ Export

3. **Replace placeholder**:
   ```bash
   # Replace the SVG placeholder with your GIF
   mv your_demo.gif docs/demo.gif
   
   # Update README to use the real demo
   # Change: ![Unbuilt Demo](./docs/demo-placeholder.svg)
   # To:     ![Unbuilt Demo](./docs/demo.gif)
   ```

4. **Commit the demo**:
   ```bash
   git add docs/demo.gif README.md
   git commit -m "Add demo animation showing key features"
   git push
   ```

## Step 5: Update Repository Links

### In README.md
Replace the placeholder live demo link:
```markdown
[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-brightgreen)](https://89a6ca3c-71b2-4a86-94dd-a44feac472df.janeway.prod.repl.run/)
```

### Add Social Preview
1. Go to repository Settings â†’ General
2. Scroll to "Social preview" 
3. Upload an image (1200x630px recommended)
4. Use the demo GIF or create a custom social card

## Step 6: Additional Enhancements

### Create Issues/Project Board
Create some initial issues to show active development:
- [ ] Add user dashboard with analytics
- [ ] Implement Stripe payment integration
- [ ] Add export to PowerPoint feature
- [ ] Create mobile app version
- [ ] Add collaborative workspace features

### Add Badges to README
```markdown
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yourusername/unbuilt)](https://github.com/yourusername/unbuilt/stargazers)
[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/yourusername/unbuilt)](https://github.com/yourusername/unbuilt/network)
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/yourusername/unbuilt)](https://github.com/yourusername/unbuilt/issues)
```

### Create Releases
Tag your first release:
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release: Unbuilt v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Step 7: Share Your Repository

Your repository will be ready to share with:
- âœ… Professional README with live demo
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation
- âœ… Clean project structure
- âœ… Demo animation/screenshots
- âœ… MIT license
- âœ… Proper .gitignore
- âœ… Environment configuration
- âœ… Setup instructions

## Repository URL Structure
Your final repository will be accessible at:
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/yourusername/unbuilt`
- **Live Demo**: Your Replit URL
- **Documentation**: `https://yourusername.github.io/unbuilt` (if GitHub Pages enabled)

## Troubleshooting

### Git Authentication Issues
If you get authentication errors:
```bash
# Use personal access token instead of password
# Or set up SSH keys as recommended by GitHub
```

### Large File Issues  
If demo GIF is too large:
```bash
# Check file size
ls -lh docs/demo.gif

# If over 100MB, use Git LFS
git lfs track "*.gif"
git add .gitattributes
```

### README Not Displaying
- Ensure README.md is in root directory
- Check markdown syntax
- Verify image paths are correct
